# BAR_GOSSIP_FOR_DLTs
A BAR Gossip Protocol for distributed ledgers, inspired primarily by the original BAR Gossip Paper and Monero's P2P implementation. This will be the main protocol for Adamnite's P2P network. You can find the PDF and Word files above. 

Please email suggestions for improvements to archchaudhury@adamnite.org.
