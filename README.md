# BAR_GOSSIP_FOR_DLTs
A BAR Gossip Protocol for distributed ledgers, inspired primarily by the original BAR Gossip Paper and Monero's P2P implementation. This is a proposal (currently succeeding) for Adamnite's P2P network. You can find the PDF and Word files above. The PDF file is recommended, as it lets you read it directly.
